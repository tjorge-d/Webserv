QUESTIONS

how to write an http server in c++?
    - Create a socket object (Sys/socker.h)
        - Store the socket in a "socket file descriptor"(int) using socket(int DOMAIN, int TYPE, int PROTOCOL)
            - Domain (protocol family used for communication) -> AF_INET (IPv4 Internet protocols)
            - Type (communication semantics) -> SOCK_STREAM (sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams)
            - Protocol (protocol to be used) -> 0 (?)
        - Bind(server-side) or Connect(client-side) the socket using bind/connect(int SOCKET, struct sockaddr *ADRESS, int ADDRESS_LEN)
            - Socket (fd) -> The value given by socket()
            - Address -> A data structure from "netinet/in.h" that needs to be filled prior (since we are using IPv4 we instanciate "sockaddr_in")
                - Adress.sin_family -> Socket (fd)
                - Adress.sin_port -> The port of the binding/connection using htons(int PORT) to convert it
                - Adress.sin_addr -> The interface (address) of the binding using htonl(u_long INTERFACE)
            - Address_len -> sizeof(Adress)
